At least one member from our team will attend the weekly Sailbot meetings, Mondays at 6:00pm. This time will serve to communicate general progress to the team captain as well as discuss upcoming purchases or testing needs. Weekly meetings with the obstacle avoidance subteam on Thursdays will be used to coordinate efforts and ensure that the detection system we develop can talk appropriately with the avoidance/navigation system the Sailbot subteam is working on.
