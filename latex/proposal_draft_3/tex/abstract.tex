Our project is to develop an obstacle detection system for use by the Sailbot autonomous sailboat in its attempt to autonomously transit the Atlantic ocean, from Newfoundland to Ireland. Our system is intended to identify hazards, providing the position of the hazards to the Sailbot's route-planning system. We plan to detect large obstacles such as container ships and fishing vessels at a range of 100m using an Automatic Identification System (AIS) receiver, which is required for all large vessels at sea. Smaller objects, such as boats below the minimum AIS size requirement, and rarely-occuring logs, icebergs, and nets will be detected at a range of several meters but not exceeding 100m by an infrared camera. This will rely on open source object identification algorithms, as well as our own code.

Our solution should have a low weight, not exceeding a few kilograms, and low power draw between 100 and 1000 mW. The power requirements exclude most commercial infrared cameras, though it is possible to build a suitable device for less than a few hundred dollars.
