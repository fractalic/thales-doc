Our project is to develop an obstacle-detection system for use by an autonomous sailboat.  The UBC Sailbot team is developing this sailbot to cross the Atlantic Ocean as part of the Microtransat challenge.  Our system must detect a wide range of hazards, including boats, nets, and floating debris, with sufficient range and precision to avoid them.  After researching a variety of detection systems, we propose a combination of IR imaging and satellite tracking.  These systems should allow detection of all anticipated categories of obstacles, while meeting the size, power, and mounting constraints of the sailbot.
