\subsection{\label{sec:resources:location-of-work}Location of Work}
Work will be completed in the Project Lab, and in the Sailbot team space in Rusty Hut. In the Project Lab, we will require a computer with python and a serial port, as well as power for a Raspberry Pi development board. The necessary test equipment is an oscilloscope and function generator.

\subsection{\label{sec:resources:budget}Budget}
Minumum budget of \$1500 for testing. Promising avenues can be pursued with additional resources after communication with the team captain, and the final system has a \$4000 soft cap. A very promising, robust and adequately tested system can be upgraded to a final version with significant financial leeway, although the team could not expand on that statement as of yet. 

\subsection{\label{sec:resources:resources}Resources}
Resources might include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Electronics hardware including an IR camera and AIS receiver
\item Mechanical components to mount and protect electronics on the Sailbot
\item Outside machine shop and/or circuit board fabrication time
\item Software applications including machine vision software such as OpenCV
\item Access to outside test facilities (wind tunnel, vibration isolation room, wave pool etc)
\end{itemize}
