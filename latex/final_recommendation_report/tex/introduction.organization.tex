This report begins with an overview of previous work on marine obstacle detection, and a discussion of theoretical background information used in the project.  We next describe the methods we used to evaluate infrared-vision-based obstacle detection and the Lepton camera, including our test rigs and data collection trips.

We discuss our experimental equipment, including a more detailed description of the test rig hardware and software, and the designs for the final camera mount and integration with Sailbot navigation software.  We then describe the results of our data collection trips, and the performance of our obstacle identification software with the resulting data.

Finally, we describe our deliverables, ongoing commitments to UBC Sailbot, and recommendations for future work.
