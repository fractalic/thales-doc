\begin{enumerate}
  \item Switch to FLIR Quark camera.  Its resolution of 640x480 pixels is a major improvement over the Lepton's 80x60, and will substantially increase the range and reliability of obstacle identification.
  \item Refine obstacle identification software based on video from new camera, to make use of improved resolution.
\end{enumerate}
