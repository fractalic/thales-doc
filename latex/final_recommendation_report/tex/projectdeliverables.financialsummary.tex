Table \ref{tab:financialsummary} shows a breakdown of the total cost of the project, where the base cost is the price of the material or item, and extra costs include highly variable expenses such as tax and machining costs. The extra cost for the battery packs is equal to \$25.25 in for express shipping plus \$11.52 in import charges. The costs of the Raspberry Pi and FLIR Lepton are the current prices on Sparkfun, converted to CAD from USD, with the extra cost consisting of six-week shipping for the Pi and express shipping for the Lepton.
