This project is sponsored by the UBC Sailbot team, with the goal of overcoming a significant challenge to autonomous robotic vessels on open water: floating hazards. Debris in the water is difficult to detect, and attempts made to cross the Atlantic ocean with such an autonomous boat have often been sunk by aquatic hazards.
