Background information is required so that problem is placed into context for the reader, and to demonstrate that the group has done sufficient evaluation of the problem and alternative solutions to trust their recommended tasks and work plan.

The section should answer the following questions:

    Who is sponsoring the project?
    What is the rationale for doing the project?
    What are the key issues to be addressed?
    Are there any existing solutions that can be acquired/purchased?   Why are these existing solutions inappropriate?

 

The Background and Motivation section is likely to contain a number of subsections, including:

    Technical background for individuals that are not experts in the field.
    Descriptions of the state of the art in commercially-available systems and in current research.
    Discussions of alternative strategies which were considered but not pursued.
    Theoretical work developed to help define the proposed solution
    Results from previous experimental work.
    Exact requirements, technical specifications, codes or standards that you must satisfy for the project.

Any technical information which may be useful as reference material for the reader but not necessary for the project can be moved to an Appendix.
