The objective of this project is to create a module capable of analyzing the dynamic nautical environment around a 5.5 meter sailboat. The device must be able to identify hazards with sufficient time for the the sailboat to navigate away from the hazard, while miniziming its power usage.

Hazards of any shape, with a volume greater than XX cc must be identifiable by the module when the sailboat is not less than X cm away from the hazard. This provides sufficient time for the sailboat to steer away from any object that might damage the boat.

Furthermore, due to power constraints, the module cannot use more than X mW of power, on average, and not more than Y mW in the worst case.

Next, the sensing device must not exceed a mass of Z kg, while it's volume should be less than XZ cc. This is necessary to maintain the balance of the boat, while minimizing aerodynamic losses.

Finally, the module must interface with the Raspberry Pi board that controls the rest of the autonomous sailboat.
